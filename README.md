# iamluv

*A playground for love, code, and creativity ‚Äî a showcase built with three.js, React, and raw emotion.*

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress. It's meant to flex my web dev chops with 3D, interactivity, and design finesse. Built using **three.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it focuses on performance, aesthetic, and experience.
>
> Expect interactive 3D animations, responsive layouts, and a sleek modern interface. It's open-source ‚Äî so dive in, break it, remix it, or just vibe with it. Feedback and contributions are more than welcome.

## Description

This project is a love letter ‚Äî literally. Dedicated to the love of my life, who lit a fire in me I didn't know existed.

It‚Äôs a tribute to the joy and inspiration that love brings. Through interactive 3D visuals and thoughtful design, I aim to capture moments, moods, and memories ‚Äî from connection to chaos, passion to peace.

Expect immersive scenes symbolizing different facets of love. It‚Äôs not just art; it's reflection. The site will also house personal writings, media, and moments that matter.

This is more than just code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a canvas. A digital shrine to creativity, emotion, and the journey so far.
